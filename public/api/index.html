      title: String,          // User-provided title
      description: String,    // User-provided description
      thumbnail: String,      // Base64 encoded JPEG thumbnail (200x200)
      created: String,        // Timestamp for when entry was created
      updated: String         // Timestamp for when entry was last updated
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

<a id="post-photos">&nbsp;</a>
### POST `/photos`
Create a new entry, uploading a new photo. A unique key is generated and only
presented once, which can be used to delete the photo.

#### Parameters
- `title` - Title for photo
- `description` - Description for photo (optional)
- `image` - Base64 encoded image

#### Response
```
{
  photo: {
    id: String,
    key: String,            // Unique key required for deleting a picture
    title: String,          // User-provided title
    description: String,    // User-provided description

    created: String,        // Timestamp for when entry was created
    updated: String         // Timestamp for when entry was last updated
  }
}
```


<a id="get-photos-id">&nbsp;</a>
### GET `/photos/[id]`
Given an `id`, retrieve an individual photo entry. The full image is included
in the response.

#### Response
```
{
  photo: {
    id: String,
    title: String,          // User-provided title
    description: String,    // User-provided description
    image: String,          // Base64 encoded JPEG image
    thumbnail: String,      // Base64 encoded JPEG thumbnail (200x200)
    created: String,        // Timestamp for when entry was created
    updated: String         // Timestamp for when entry was last updated
  }
}
```


<a id="put-photos-id">&nbsp;</a>
### PUT `/photos/[id]`
Given an `id`, update an existing entry. Parameters not provided will be
cleared server side. (`thumbnail` is an exception as it is dependent on
`image`. In addition, `key` is required to modify.)

- `title` - Title for photo
- `description` - Description for photo
- `image` - Base64 encoded image

#### Response
```
{
  photo: {
    id: String,
    title: String,          // User-provided title
    description: String,    // User-provided description
    image: String,          // Base64 encoded JPEG image
    thumbnail: String,      // Base64 encoded JPEG thumbnail (200x200)
    created: String,        // Timestamp for when entry was created
    updated: String         // Timestamp for when entry was last updated
  }
}
```

### PATCH `/photos/[id]`
Like [PUT](#put-photos-id), update an existing entry given an `id`. However,
